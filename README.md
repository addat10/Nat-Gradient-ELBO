# Code for paper: On the Natural Gradient of the Evidence Lower Bound

This repository contains the simulation code to reproduce the figures from the paper "On the Natural Gradient of the Evidence Lower Bound" by Nihat Ay, Jesse van Ostrum and Adwait Datar.

The code has the following entry points:
1. Produce integral curves under gradient flow for cylindrical and non-cylindrical model examples: grad_flow_main.m
2. Produce histograms for the cosine similarities: cosine_similarity_main.m

## Prerequisites
The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment:
* *Windows 11 Pro* Version 23H2
* *Matlab* 2023a
